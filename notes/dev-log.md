Finished separating MVP and Stretch, set up backend repo. Working on permissions issue when trying to install node module:

```RONALDs-MacBook-Pro-2 dev/restauranter-backend ‹master*› » npm install --global belly
npm WARN checkPermissions Missing write access to /usr/local/lib/node_modules/belly
npm WARN checkPermissions Missing write access to /usr/local/lib/node_modules```
